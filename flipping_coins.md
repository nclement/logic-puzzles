# Flipping Coins
Categories: logic, coins

There are twenty coins sitting on the table, ten are currently heads and tens 
are currently tails. You are sitting at the table with a blindfold and gloves
on. You are able to feel where the coins are, but are unable to see or feel if
they heads or tails. You must create two sets of coins. Each set must have the
same number of heads and tails as the other group. You can only move or flip
the coins, you are unable to determine their current state.

**How do you create two even groups of coins with the same number of heads
and tails in each group?**

 - At a recent painting competition, Eileen's rendition of a Constable was not last.
 - Jenny only just managed to avoid last place and came third.
 - The lady who painted a Monet was very successful and took first place.
 - Ada beat the lady who painted the Taylor and the lady who painted the Van Gogh beat Vera.

Can you determine who painted what and who won?

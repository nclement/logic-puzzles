# Five Pirates
Categories: logic, math

5 pirates of different ages have a treasure of 100 gold coins. 

On their ship, they decide to split the coins using this scheme: 

 - The oldest pirate proposes how to share the coins, and ALL pirates
 (including the oldest) vote for or against it. 

 - If 50% or more of the pirates vote for it, then the coins will be shared
 that way. Otherwise, the pirate proposing the scheme will be thrown overboard, and the process is repeated with the pirates that remain.

 - As pirates tend to be a bloodthirsty bunch, if a pirate would get the same
 number of coins if he voted for or against a proposal, he will vote against
 so that the pirate who proposed the plan will be thrown overboard.

Assuming that all 5 pirates are intelligent, rational, greedy, and do not
wish to die, (and are rather good at math for pirates) what will happen?
